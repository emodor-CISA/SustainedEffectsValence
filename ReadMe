*** WHAT IS IN THIS FOLDER ***
****************************** 

Your download file from Yareta includes:
	all raw MRI data (in Nifti format) used in study
	all raw physiology data (in .acq format) used in study
	all matlab files containing the behavioural data. 
	Code used in the study

The data stored here is data for 20 participants, labelled 10 through to 29. All data was collected over 2 days, in 4 runs (8 runs total).
	
MRI data is contained in folder labelled separately for each subject ('Nifti-subject number-func-sess1' for the first day, the same-sess2 for the second day) and files are saved under the four 
	separate runs within these folders (eg: sub-10_ses-1_run1-TR2000_bold.nii for day 1, run 1; sub-10_ses-1_run2-TR2000_bold.nii for day 1, run 2).

Anatomy files for each subject are in the folder Anat_AllSubs

The raw physiology data for day 1 can be found in Physiology-allSubs-sess1, for day 2 in Physiology-allSubs-sess2. 
	Physiology data has been split in to the four runs and are labelled as such (eg: sub-10-ses-1_Run1.acq for day 1, run 1)

Matlab files can be found in the individual nifti folders. The onsets of events for the MRI have also been made available in the same folders in .txt files.

Code used in the study can be found in the folder "Code"

Once this data has been saved in Yareta, the deposit cannot be modified. If modifications or updates are necessary, they will be noted here.
