This file explains to you how to obtain the results found in the paper "Sustained Effects of Pleasant and Unpleasant Smells on Brain Activity" 
by Heather Carlson, Joana Leitao, Sylvain Delplanque, Isabelle Cayeux, David Sander, and Patrik Vuilleumier

******************************
*** WHAT IS IN THIS FOLDER ***
****************************** 

Your download file from Yareta includes:

	all raw MRI data (in Nifti format) used in study
	all raw physiology data (in .acq format) used in study
	all behavioural data (onsets and timing of resting state and smell periods, reponses and response timing, smell used in trials, etc) 
	Code used in the study
	Ratings of stimuli prior to the study

The data stored here is data for 20 participants, labelled 10 through to 29. All data was collected over 2 days, in 4 runs (8 runs total).
	
1) /PreStudyRatings.xlsx
	Pre-study ratings are contained in the excel spreadsheet. These were ratings of pleasantness and intensities of different smells by 10 unrelated volunteers 

2) /Code/
	Code used in the study can be found in the folder "Code"
	Please see the Read Me file in the code folder for a full description of the contents of the code and how to use them.
	Within the code folder, there are 5 folders:
		Experiment_Code : the code used to do the experiment
		PreprocessingMRIData: code used to preprocess the MRI data using SPM12
		PreprocessPhysiology: code used to preprocess the physiology data for use as a regressor in the SPM GLM
		GLM: code used to do a first and second level anlaysis for the SPM GLM
		Connectivity Code: Code used for the wavelet transform, permutation, and random forest

3) /Nifti/

	/Nifti/s_#/anat
		Anatomy files for each subject are in the folder anat, for example, /Nifti/s_10/anat
		Anatomy folders contain .nii copies of the T1 and SWI files (SWI was not used in the experiment), in addition to .json header files. 

	Nifti/s_#/ses-#/func
		MRI data is contained in the Nifti folder labelled separately for each subject, with separate folders for each day. For example
		\Nifti\s_10\ses-1\func --> contains the functional files for the four runs on day 1
		\Nifti\s_10\ses-2\func -- > contains the functional files for the four runs on day 2
		Each folder contains .nii files for each of the runs, labelled run 1 - 4, in addition to a .json header file.
		Each folder also contains .txt files with the onset times and end times for the resting state trials and smell trials (labelled accordingly)
		(this can also be found in participant's matlab files)
		Each folder also contains the participant matlab files which are the ouput from the experiment (see below, number 4, for an overview of the matlab file contents).

	Nifti/s_#/ses-#/physiology
		Physiology data (heart, respiration, triggers, and skin conductance): 
		The raw data can be found in subject session folders, under physiology.
		Eg: \Nifti\s_10\ses-1\physiology for day 1
		There are four .acq files, one for each run, labelled accordingly.

	Nifti/DataSet_BehaviouralResponsesUsedinStudy.xlsx
		Finally, in Nifti/ there is an excel spreadsheet containing the participant responses to pleasantness, intensity, concentration, resting state responses, PANAS-X and STAI questions, as well as participant age and sex information
		With the exception of STAI, participant information, and PANAS-X, all of these responses can also be found in the matlab output file.



4) Matlab files
	The matlab files were the output from running the experiment code (see Code/Experiment_Code/Main.m). There is one matlab file for each subject day for the four runs.
	If you open a matlab file, it contains the following information:
		DATA.meta: you can find the odor label of the trial here, as well as the corresponding trigger number, in .odorLabel and .odorTrigger
		DATA.duration: the durations of all events - in particular, the concentration/concentration question, intensity, liking (pleasantness), familiar, and resting state question give the duration of participant reaction times to the question asked during the study  
		DATA.response: responses from participants on smell itensity, pleasantness, familiarity, post resting state question, and concentration
		DATA.onset: the timing of the onset of different events - in particular concentrationStart for onset of smell, liking intensity familiar concentrationQuestionand restingstateQuestion for the onset of the respective questions, and restingstate for onset of restingstate trial.
